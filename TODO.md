# TODO

## PRIORITIES / CURRENT STATE

* [ ] Make sure taxonomies are ok (working correctly and not missing anything)
* [ ] Continue/finish sidebar on homepage
    * [ ] See how taxonomies are ordered
        => specified where/how?
    * [ ] Add subscription (?)
        => check with notes
* [ ] Check sidebar stuff for "single" (post)
* [ ] Add default case for theme stuff (if current value in local storage is not valid, use default case)
    => set as index 0 in themes list (so ok even if have only 1 theme)
* [ ] Handle themes more cleanly
    => see how could be more modular (adding new theme by simply adding new files in the specific locations)
    - not in theme but in website
    - in assets dir
    - other?
    => then just add entry to params.toml
    ! - SHOULD BE DETECTED AUTOMATICALLY, AND THE LIST GENERATED BY BUILT INSTEAD OF BEING HARDCODED IN PARAMS.TOML
